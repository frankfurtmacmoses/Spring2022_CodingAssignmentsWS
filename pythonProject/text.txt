Glimpse is an indexing and query system that allows for search through a file system or
document collection quickly. Glimpse is the default search engine in a larger information
retrieval system. It has also been used as part of some web based search engines
The main processes in a retrieval system are document indexing, query processing, query
evaluation and relevance feedback. Among these, efficient updating of the index is critical in
large scale systems.
Clusters are created from short snippets of documents retrieved by web search engines which
are as good as clusters created from the full text of web documents.
